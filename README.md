# Adversarial Malware Detection

This project focuses on adversarial malware detection using deep learning techniques. It trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify benign and malicious files and evaluates the model's robustness against adversarial attacks.

## Features

- **Model Training**: Train a CNN on a dataset of benign and malicious samples.
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Generate adversarial examples using Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM).
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance on clean and adversarial data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adversarial-malware-detection.git
   cd adversarial-malware-detection
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy adversarial-robustness-toolbox
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of benign and malicious samples.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model, generate adversarial examples, and evaluate performance:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the notebook and execute the cells sequentially.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains training and testing datasets.
- `model/`: Stores the trained model file `malware_detection_model.h5`.
